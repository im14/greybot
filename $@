The difference between $@ and $*: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, "$@" expands to each parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ..., while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c...", where 'c' is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@" (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}".
