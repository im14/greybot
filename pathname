If a pathname starts with "/" then the starting position is the root directory, otherwise it is the current directory. It is then split into components separated by "/", and taking each component in turn, it moves to the named subdirectory (or any named object, for the last component), except where a component is "..", when it moves up to the parent directory, or "." or empty, when it does not move.
