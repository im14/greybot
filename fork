When bash creates a subshell or executes an external command, it needs to fork. Avoid forking unless you have a good reason to: solutions that fork are often slower, even more so on machines where forking is expensive (eg. ''[[ $ext = *.txt ]]'' is much faster than ''echo "$foo" | grep -q "\.txt$"'').
