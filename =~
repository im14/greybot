The =~ operator of [[ evaluates the left hand string against the right hand extended regular expression (ERE). After a successful match, BASH_REMATCH can be used to expand matched groups from the pattern. Quoted parts of the regex become literal. To be safe & compatible, put the regex in a parameter and do [[ $string =~ $regex ]]
