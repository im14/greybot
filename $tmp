Avoid short and meaningless variable names. Use your variable names to communicate what they hold: the more your naming says, the better your code reads. $file, not $f. $remoteHost, not $h. One convention is to use singular words for regular variables, plural for arrays and the first letter of the array for indexes in that array (eg. for f in "${!files[@]}" / for file in "${files[@]}").
