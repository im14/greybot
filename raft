Read A Fucking Tutorial! We are NOT here to teach you the very basic beginner steps of bash scripting. You are expected to know basic stuff like "how do I redirect a command's output to a file" and "what's a glob" before you come here. There are links in the channel /topic. Use them BEFORE asking anything!
