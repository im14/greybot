Some people, when wanting to answer a question, decide that they will make the bot answer for them. That's why we create so many factoids. You can see my factoid "database" on the web, at http://wooledge.org/~greybot/ (Actually, this is the metadata database, so you can see the deleted ones here as well as the active ones.)
